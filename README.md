The gameboard. make your selections, and the scoreboard will keep score of who is the winner.


# what I would like to improve

- tkinter doesn't have a native capability to open new windows, so my solution is a bit unorthodox, and as such you can forward (to the gameboard), but not then back to the homepage.

- The AI currently is just a random selection of the available spaces, so I would like to experiment with building more successful ways for the computer to play this game. There are some interesting ways of having the computer essentially play all possible games from that point, and choose the best option, so I would like to try that.
